The **Greenpeace] Nordic 3-Year Strategy (2025-2027)** is built around three core pillars—**Hope, Community, and Courage**—to drive impactful environmental action and resilience in the face of global crises. Here's a quick summary:

1. **Hope**: Greenpeace aims to inspire hope through bold campaigns and actions, emphasizing that collective action can lead to a sustainable future. The strategy focuses on creating a vision of resilience and survival, countering fear and division with positive, science-based solutions.
    
2. **Community**: Strengthening and expanding the Greenpeace community is central. The strategy prioritizes deepening relationships with existing supporters (donors, volunteers) while engaging new audiences. By empowering the community to act and persuade others, Greenpeace aims to build a powerful movement for change.
    
3. **Courage**: Greenpeace commits to courageous actions that challenge powerful industries (oil, agriculture, forestry) and governments. The strategy emphasizes disruptive, inspiring actions that pressure targets, shift public discourse, and defend the right to protest in shrinking democratic spaces.
    

### Additional Key Priorities:

- **Finance Strategy**: Rebuild financial reserves, reduce operational costs, and grow fundraising to ensure sustainability.
    
- **Growth Plan**: Expand donor base, improve digital fundraising, and focus on high-value donors to raise 757 million SEK over three years.
    
- **Brand Enhancement**: Reinforce Greenpeace’s brand to appeal to younger audiences and maintain relevance in a noisy media landscape.
    
- **Digital Transformation**: Improve data and digital maturity to enhance campaign effectiveness and operational efficiency.
    
- **Empowering People & Culture**: Foster a culture of trust, inclusivity, and agility to adapt to a leaner structure.
    
- **Intersectional Campaigning**: Address environmental issues through a justice lens, ensuring campaigns are inclusive and challenge systemic oppression.
    
- **Activism & Direct Actions**: Expand disruptive and inspiring actions to pressure targets and inspire hope.
    
- **Campaigning in Right-Wing Contexts**: Navigate political challenges by building alliances and maintaining bold, clear positions on green transition.
    

The strategy aims to create tangible change in the Nordic region, inspire activism, and ensure Greenpeace remains a powerful voice for environmental justice.
