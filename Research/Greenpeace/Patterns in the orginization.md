**The computer**
- The holy grail at Greenpeace
- The communication tool
- The research tool
- The meeting platform


**Lack of onboarding**



**"Im busy"**
- Becomes a narrative 


**Meeting culture**
- Always with computer open
- Not a lot of facilitation
- No use of tools


**The coffee machine**



**Misalignment in dates**



**Reflected decisions?**
