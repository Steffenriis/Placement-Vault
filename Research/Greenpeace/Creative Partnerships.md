### STRATEGY
The **Denmark Creative Partnerships Strategy (2025-2027)** aims to strengthen Greenpeace Denmark's engagement with creative partners (influencers, content creators, etc.) to amplify campaigns, enhance brand visibility, and drive impact. Key goals include:

1. **Capacity Building**: Strengthen collaboration between Programme and Fundraising, participate in global training, and analyze needs by end of 2025.
    
2. **Advocacy & Branding**: Enhance visibility, refine resources for creators, and align partnerships with Greenpeace’s values.
    
3. **Long-Term Relationships**: Build lasting partnerships with 2-5 high-impact creators, develop an ambassador program, and ensure continuity through knowledge management.
    
4. **Fundraising**: Test partnerships for fundraising by leveraging existing relationships and collaborating with diverse communities.
    

The strategy addresses challenges like internal capacity gaps and a competitive influencer landscape through training, fair compensation, and audience-centric approaches. Creative partners will share Greenpeace’s values and help drive environmental change. By 2027, the program aims to be robust, globally integrated, and impactful.
