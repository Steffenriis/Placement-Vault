Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is a psychological theory that suggests human needs are arranged in a five-tier pyramid, with basic needs at the bottom and more complex needs at the top. The levels are:

1. **Physiological Needs**: Basic survival needs like food, water, shelter, and sleep.
    
2. **Safety Needs**: Security, stability, and protection from harm (physical and emotional).
    
3. **Love and Belonging**: Relationships, friendships, love, and social connections.
    
4. **Esteem Needs**: Respect, recognition, self-esteem, and the desire for accomplishment.
    
5. **Self-Actualization**: Achieving personal potential, growth, creativity, and fulfilling oneâ€™s life purpose.
