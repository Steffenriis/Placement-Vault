#### **2. Belonging**

- Belonging is one of the most fundamental human needs. Activism often creates a **community** where people can connect and feel they are part of something larger than themselves. The feeling of belonging to a movement can be a powerful motivator.
    
- **Social Networks**: Research in **social capital** (Putnam) shows that people who feel they belong to supportive networks are more likely to take action, both in their personal lives and in movements.


- **Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs** places **safety** as a foundational need. Activists might initially get involved in causes driven by the need to secure their environment or community’s safety—such as working to protect vulnerable populations or advocating for environmental policies to ensure long-term sustainability.
    
- **Perceived Safety**: Activism can also be a way of seeking safety in a broader sense, such as economic stability, freedom, or even psychological security in knowing they are standing for a moral cause.
