**Observations
- You can practice your focus through visually focusing
- We get used to watching moving things (videos on the internet) and they contain so many pictures in a short amount of time. This means that you can only focus on a specific point at a very short amount of time which means that your overall focus decreases. 

[[**Ultradian cycles**]]
You experience life through Ultradian cycles.
![[Pasted image 20250421133331.png]]
These are 90 minutes cycles of focus (Warmup - Max focus - Stress - Break)
You can use these to design you day so you avoid spending a lot of time being very little productive and just "doomscrolling". 

It also says that you need breaks inbetween these cycles - breaks where you don't take in new information (eg. phone or conversations etc.)

- Keeping eye contact can affect your ability to focus a lot - because when doing that you take in a lot of visual information which makes it difficult for you to listen and actually hear what is said. 



**Reflections & Interpretations:**

- I have been playing a lot of computer when i was a kid. I think that has affected my ability to keep focus because in gaming there are new pictures all the time. 
- This can be used in reflections of [[information overload]] or [[curiosity]] research
- This can also be used in terms of orginizational development - Greenpeace use a lot of time on their computers - for example reading news which affects their ability to be curious and think new
