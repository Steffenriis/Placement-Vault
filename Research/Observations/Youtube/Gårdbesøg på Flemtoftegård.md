**Observations** 
- This is a video from lanbrug ungdom where the setting is a gathering for young farmers
- The video asks why the young people are a part of "Gårdbesøget" 
  - It's a nice place to say hi to each other and connect after a days work
  - To get contacts and socailize
  - I am here for the community 
  - I am here to be with people with the same interests as me


**Reflections & Interpretations**
- This might seem weird to use but i think it shows the fundemental of human beings and that even though you are not working towards some sustainable goal it is still the same drivers that works for you - community
- I think it is important in order to understand the whole system
- Can i use this perspective in some way?
- It is not the farmers fault (especially not the young) that they are not doing something that is sustainable - they were just born into this system
