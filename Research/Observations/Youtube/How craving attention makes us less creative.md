**Observation**
- The ted talk talks about how we from cracing attention with the example of social media never will reviece a sense of fulfillment because we would always want more
- He explains how that craving of wanting attention blurres your mind of creativity because your intention is not your own motivation to create something amazing but it's the attention. 
  

**Quick reflections & interpretations**
- This means that this craving for attention or focus on your own ego will reduce your capacity to actually create something that is meaningful and original - all you do will be a product of the time or what others do
