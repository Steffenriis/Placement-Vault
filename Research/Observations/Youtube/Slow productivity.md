##### 3 Principles

1. **Do fewer things at once**
   - This allows you to concentrate and use full capapcity on one thing. 
   - You will complete things faster and at a higher pace
   - When you switch focus from one to another thing it takes a while to reorient and find focus (attention Residue - basically you leave some of your capacity at the place you just left)
2. Work at a natural space**
- Season and variation matter! It is okay to have busy and less busy days and seasons
3. **. Obsess over quality**
- Invest in better tools - you tend to want to do a better work
- Focus on what you do well

**[[Pseudo Productivity]]
- Visual activity becomes a measurement for productivity - ex. u spend more time on work, you are more active in the slack chat 
- More of our time is focused on performing busy'ness
