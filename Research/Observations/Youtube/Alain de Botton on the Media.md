The narrative
- By knowing more we would care more

2 ways to passive citizens
1. North Korea - stop all news
2. Flood them with news

Theurepeutic news
- More focused on the genuine requirements of the audience

- There used to be a distinguishingg of important news that was in the front but know it is the gossip news in the front
  _ Example with climate change pictures decreased reader ands picture with taylor swift increases it - Serious problem! 

Politicans need to have their citizen care about important news 
It is a problem for our democracy

Populirization 
- There are archetypes of stories that keeps coming back and back - there is very little that is actually new - we need to train ourselves to spot the archetypes

- We can read about 300 people dying from some event and then go to sleep 5 minutes after not caring at all - are we crazy or what?
- The news are so focused on giving us information that it forgets to make us actually care about it (Empathy)
- You can't care about 300 people dying if you never knew they existed
- How to make people care? Through art, in news it is photojournalism - a good picture is very very important
  A GOOD PICTURE: A bearer of new information (example with close up picture of humans rather than), Example with regular picture of Obama speaking in front of people and picture playing with a kid playing spider man
As consumers we need to reduce the amount of stories

- Example of a story where a man goes kill his two kids and himself which got an insane amount of views "Are we crazy?"
- Example of car crashes and plane crashes - we are searching for the meaning of life by the thought and awareness of death 
  The problem is that the news dont pick up the threads - we are compelled but are left with anxiety 

Aristoteles:
- There is a human apetite for very dark stories - a human that do something catastrophic and ruin themselves (A Tragedy)
- The greatest horrors have a role to play in building up civilization WHY? They teach us fear and pity and that we are all near the edge of disaster all the time therefore we need to be scared for ourselves or pity the person that has pushed themselves over the edge
  "I belive we need to learn to use this news"


The media make us scared of everything
Rememeber that the news are not the normal

NEws of medicine are very popular because it gives us the hope that we can win against death

Celebrity news are very popular - we can't do without celebrities (they are role models) What is important is that who do we picture as the role models? (Creative partnerships)
==A well functioning society is one that have useful role models (A lack of heroes?)==

Envy 
- Example with famous or rich people
- We should use this feeling of envy - ask ourselves what is making me envious? we can use this as a guide of where we should be heading with life


Bias
- Claiming that we need bias as a sort of guidance - conteract against that we have to make up what we mean or think about certain news


People who care very deeply and know things are wrong have been watching the wrong news because they have no good ideas about what to change. A desperate naivity and sentimentallity allied with real energy to change is a recipe to disaster. 

The news are partially responsible for creating the world that marries up this genuine passion with ignorance and defangs the ability for change. 
The news are obsessed with bad guys and it hates systemic problems (they are too messy) - most problems are a lot more suttle and the news can't see them

The news are supposed to be the most important thing in our society and we got to make sure that it really is the important stuff. Sometimes what is important is what happend the last hour but sometimes we need to stretch our objects 3000 years

The news are the most wonderful tool of distraction ever invented. Sometimes we need to put them away and do our own agenda
We need more room and time for reflection and we might get the time to see what is around us

Example: I am just sitting and watching the news (Sounds serious) vs. i am just sitting and looking out the window and thinking about a memory of my childholld (Come on you should go do something useful!)
