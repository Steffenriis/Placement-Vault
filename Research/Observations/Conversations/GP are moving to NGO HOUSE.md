**Observation**
- Greenpeace are moving office to a house filled with NGO
- The idea is to be around similar NGO's in order to create synergy effect across sectors

- Greeenpeace realize that they need to collaborate
- Personal reflection is that i don't really feel them seeing the potential in this - its more of a "Yeah that sounds cool" without a lot more thought than that

**Relatability**
