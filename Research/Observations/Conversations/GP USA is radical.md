**Observations**
A conversation with a GP USA employee

- We talked about how GP USA are more radical and driven by frustration due to the political situation in the country
- I asked if the different offices were different and she said "They are not the same at all"
- We also talked about the power of having national offices because they are connected with their different contexts
