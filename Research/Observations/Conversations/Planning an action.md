**Observations**
From an actionplanning meeting discussing the action of TotalEnergies 101 birthday
- We went directly to talk about how are we going to do it, with the opening questions "so what are we going to do at the action?"
- There were no facilitation other than the question
- The conversation when a bit in different direction
- I posed the questions of why are we doing this and how do we not just make this a joke?
  -This was caught by Rikke who emphasized the need to focus on the why
  -We talked a bit about this but it seemed like some where tapping out of the conversation

**Quick interpretations & reflections**
- Lack a focus on the why but i also want to emphasize that sometimes it is just about action a lot of the why lies in the whole campaign work
