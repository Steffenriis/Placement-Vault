**Quick interpretations & Reflections**
- It is really remarkable to notice how much people stand up for the community
- A reflection is that a [[motivational factor is resistance]] 
- How Greepeace respond to such thing is by fighting back which is great - but i can't help thinking that the only thing they know is to fight. And maybe that is also okay but when i think about the story of [[ The detective and the Villian]] what then happens to the detective when it doesn't have something to fight? It decays - is that a good or a bad think?
