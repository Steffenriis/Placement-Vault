**Observation**
- A conversation with my colleague Ida, a 25 year old activist, who were part of a demonstration against Maersk and their transportation of military equipment.

She said "I get fuelled with energy from this kind of thing"
I asked "Why?"
She said: It's something about being part of something bigger, a community..... almost a cult feeling"
Another point in the conversation i asked about if the demonstration was a succes
The answer: "Yes, because we got a lot of media coverage and attention"

**Quick interpretation and reflections**
- Activism is a community
- Activism is about getting attention and creating awareness
- Activists are feeded by the feeling of a cult/movement - the feeling of being part of something bigger

**Relatability**
- Motivational factors within activism
- What is [[Activism]]
[[Motivations]]

[[Community - A weapon]]
