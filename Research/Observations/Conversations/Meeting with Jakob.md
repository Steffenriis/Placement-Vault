#### **NOTES**

- [[We reached the point of behavioral change]] - we need decisions from above - example with Covid19
- We need to learn to [[speak their language]]
- There is a gap between companies and activism where Jakob tries to be the bridgebuilder who both tries to understand the big companies and try to nudge them from the inside
- Jakob thinks there is a [[general lack of reflection]] - Consciousness about the decisions you make - seeing the connection an impact to the larger system 
- Jakobs motivation is when things are not going well [[motivational factor is resistance]]
- Jakob talks about the weird thing about people leaving their values at home when they go to work and talks about how can we unite those two "I's" [[The work "I"]]
- Jakob mentions that visions is something most companies have, but the problem with them is that they don't really use them

#### **AI SUMMARY OF TRANSCRIPTION**


The meeting covered a wide range of topics, focusing on systemic change, activism, behavioral shifts, and the interplay between individual motivations, organizational strategies, and societal structures. Below is a summary that integrates both parts of the meeting:

---

### Key Themes and Discussions:

#### 1. **Systemic Change and Activism**:

- The speaker explored the concept of systemic change through the lens of "crime stories," where activists often focus on revealing villains (e.g., corporations or individuals causing harm). However, this approach was critiqued for its cyclical nature—once one villain is exposed, another often emerges, leading to limited long-term change.
    
- The idea of **collaboration** over opposition was emphasized. Instead of merely opposing villains, the speaker advocated for working toward **shared goals** and fostering partnerships between activists, corporations, and other stakeholders.
    
- The discussion also touched on the role of **media narratives**, particularly how crime stories and fear-driven narratives dominate public discourse. Figures like Donald Trump were cited as examples of using fear and sensationalism to shape public opinion.
    

#### 2. **Fear and Decision-Making**:

- The concept of **fear** as a driving force in decision-making was a recurring theme. The speaker referenced Michael Nussbaum's _Monarchy of Fear_, which argues that fear often dictates both personal and political decisions, stifling visionary thinking.
    
- This fear-driven approach was contrasted with the need for **forward-looking, vision-driven action**. The speaker expressed concern that fear-based narratives (e.g., climate catastrophe) often paralyze people rather than inspire meaningful action.
    

#### 3. **Activism and Corporate Partnerships**:

- The role of NGOs like **Greenpeace** was discussed, particularly their tendency to create "enemy images" to drive activism. While this approach has its place, the speaker advocated for more **collaborative strategies**, such as forming long-term partnerships with corporations.
    
- The idea of aligning corporate values with activist goals was highlighted. For example, creating partnerships focused on specific issues (e.g., mental health or sustainability) rather than one-off donations could lead to more impactful change.
    
- The speaker shared personal experiences of working as a sustainability consultant, where they introduced tools like **science-based targets** to help companies align their strategies with broader climate goals.
    

#### 4. **Behavioral Change and Systemic Challenges**:

- The conversation addressed the difficulty of driving **behavioral change**, especially in corporate settings. Many companies adopt sustainability goals (e.g., reducing CO2 emissions) but often lack a deep understanding of how to achieve them.
    
- The speaker emphasized the importance of **authenticity** and **passion** in driving change, rather than simply following trends or fear of falling behind. They shared experiences of working as an "undercover activist" within corporations, trying to influence decision-makers from within.
    

#### 5. **Social Connection and Responsibility**:

- The concept of the **Social Connection Model** by Iris Marion Young was introduced, which focuses on understanding how individuals and organizations are interconnected within larger systems. This model encourages **forward-looking responsibility** rather than dwelling on past mistakes.
    
- The speaker stressed the need for creating **moral and practical links** between global issues (e.g., climate change) and local actions, helping people see their role in broader systems.
    

#### 6. **Challenges in Driving Change**:

- The discussion highlighted the difficulty of maintaining **urgency** and **momentum** in activism, especially as public attention wanes over time.
    
- The speaker expressed frustration with the slow pace of change and the need for more **decisive action**, potentially driven by government intervention or collective shifts in mindset.
    

#### 7. **Bridging Sectors**:

- The speaker emphasized the importance of bridging different sectors (e.g., activism, research, and business) to drive systemic change. Siloed thinking often hinders progress, and collaboration across sectors is crucial for addressing complex issues like climate change.
    
- Examples like **KOR (Klima- og Omstillingsrådet)** were mentioned, where researchers from diverse backgrounds come together to engage in activism and apply their knowledge to real-world problems.
    

#### 8. **Motivation and Action**:

- The discussion explored what motivates individuals and organizations to take action. While some are driven by **hope** and positive stories, others are motivated by the urgency of avoiding negative outcomes (e.g., climate catastrophe).
    
- The speaker noted that **fear-based narratives** can be paralyzing, while **hope-driven narratives** might lead to complacency. Striking a balance between the two is crucial for effective activism.
    

#### 9. **Reflection and Role of Corporations**:

- The speaker stressed the importance of **reflection** for both individuals and corporations. Companies need to move beyond superficial commitments to sustainability and consider their **role in society** more deeply.
    
- The idea of **corporate maturity** was introduced, where companies take responsibility for their actions and their broader impact on society, rather than just following trends or ticking boxes.
    

#### 10. **Personal Reflections and Activism**:

- The speaker shared personal reflections on their journey into activism, emphasizing the importance of being surrounded by like-minded individuals who are driven by a shared sense of purpose.
    
- They also discussed the challenges of balancing **academic rigor** with the need for **action-oriented approaches**, noting that academia often moves too slowly for the urgency of the issues at hand.
