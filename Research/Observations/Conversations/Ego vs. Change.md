**Observation**
- "Our weakest link is always our own egos"
- "How do we quiet our own egos to serve the movement rather than trying to get something out if it"
- I also have an observation from a conversation with Amalie: Julie (Her friend) arguing about motives of people being at a demonstration just to be part of something and to be cool
**Quick interpretations & reflections**
- An assumption is that this is quite present in the world of activism today. - I get this sense of it is for my own feeling of being part of something or it's cool to go out and yell warcries with your friends rather than the intention is something truly focused on creating a better world
- I was thinking of the Monarchy of fear and that we are so controlled by seeking safety within communities and yourself.
- Another thought from the monarchy of fear is that the fear of what you might lose of the world collapses
- QUESTION: Is it okay that peoples intentions are egocentered when they are serving a good cause?
