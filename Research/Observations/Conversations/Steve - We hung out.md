**Observations**

A conversation with Steve (A volunteer who have been apart for 36 years in GP)

- "Back in the days we were always hanging out"
- Saying that there were way more action back in the days
- Saying that at some point a corporizing of GP happend - a lot less actions and volunteer engagement.
- "We were passionate back then"

**Quick interpretations & Reflections**Â 

- Greenpeace went through a transition and has in some way followed the changing society for godd and bad
- I see the same transition in Kaospilot
