**Observations**

Greenpeace international is a support system - basically the independent NRO's can say no to the guidelines they send out

Currently being worked on a [[shared data collection]] bank in GPI in order to have shared knowledge and to have impact metrics - how many are signing petitition internationally and how is our campaign doing compared to other countries etc.

[[Drivers in countries are very different]] in terms of culture, motivaitons GDPR, communication etc.
Ex. Finland are way more driven by threats where Denmark is more driven by positive news
This is why the international offices are so important

We talked about the happiness index and why Finland is higher than DK - In Finland the mentally of people really care about the things they own, they repair them and take care of them. Also way more people actually have a craft to repair things

It also shows how [[privilege is a curse]] and causing you to always want more 

[[Trust is a challenge]] in Greenpeace internationally caused by bad experiences


**Interpretations & Reflections**
GPI are trying to take advantage of that Greenpeace is so big but faces a lot of challenges because of the differences in countries
