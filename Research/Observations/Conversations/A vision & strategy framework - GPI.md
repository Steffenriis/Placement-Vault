- A conversations with a Greenpeace international employee

**Observations**
- Greenpeace international makes a strategy & framework that the regional offices has to respond to when they do campaigns
- 80 % of the regional offices' campaign has to be in alignment with what Greenpeace international decide
- A challenge that the real world sometimes is different than the strategy and vision they lay out - how to also give autonomy to the regional offices
- There is a coordination team in Amsterdam
- "It is our job to facilitate the conversation between International and NRO's"



**Reflections & interpretations**
- It seems like everything is very much in order with Greenpeace, but my reflection is that the link between Greenpeace international and NRO's makes it really difficult to make the NRO's care about the vision of GP international
