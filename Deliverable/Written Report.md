#Placement Report  

“Your opponents would love you to believe that it’s hopeless, that you have no power, that there’s no reason to act, that you can't win.”  External mentor  Henrique Nascimento (Creative director – Transformative times, Program director – Porto Business school) - 2 sessions  Learning Group members Amalie Elkjær Elisabeth Christensen  Mathilde Nyborg Terese Kejser  Taskgiver and placement responisble Lauren Bowey - Campaigner   

Introduction to placement In my placement period I have entered the field of Activism by joining Greenpeace Denmark.  [“Greenpeace is a global network of independent campaigning organizations that use peaceful protest and creative confrontation to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green, just, and joyful future.”](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/about/) In the organization I joined the campaign team where my tasks were to assist with the already existing workflow, such as development and writing of an article, researching for campaigns (e.g. who to contact, data), participate in actions and joining office and campaign development meetings. In the client agreement it was decided that these tasks would vary depending on how the period, tasks and responsibilities would change.    A TIMELINE   

Evaluation with client – INSERT MIRO*  Throughout the placement, I had weekly check-ins with Lauren Bowey to align tasks, challenges, and changes. 

In the last week of the period, we had a one-hour session addressing challenges and strengths of the collaboration.  Following pinpoints from Lauren Bowey and my last evaluation:  Tasks Lauren expressed positive energy toward my task delivery, highlighting my commitment, thoroughness, and reflection as clear strengths. I appreciated the flexibility and mandate to shape my tasks and choose where to invest my energy.  Onboarding A lack of onboarding, limited my ability to fully participate in meetings and for us to explore deeper impact. Lauren acknowledged this as an ongoing challenge within Greenpeace, and I recognized that I could have been more persistent in addressing my need for clearer onboarding—a valuable learning for both sides.  Communication I reflected that I could have communicated my skills and Kaospilot background more clearly, as I often felt my abilities didn’t come into play despite delivering on tasks. Much of the work was more about maintaining and supporting ongoing activities — a shift that challenged my expectations and led to reflections for both sides in our weekly meetings. However, Lauren noted that I communicated my needs well during the period, allowing us to adapt tasks effectively.   Conclusion Overall, while the collaboration didn’t fully realize its potential, it offered valuable lessons for me, and Greenpeace was satisfied with the work I contributed with.    

WHAT? Me & Greenpeace  

Why did I choose to apply for Greenpeace?  

I wanted to be around passionate people 

I am highly driven by passion and visions, and I have longed to be around people with that same drive.  

Activism is a symbol for change 

It made sense to combine activism and Kaospilot because change is both our main purpose and driver. I thought I could expand my practice of working with change with ideas from activism.  

Knowledge 

From my previous project my interest for big societal structures started. I gained a lot of knowledge then, but it was just like opening a box that I wanted to explore way more. So, I chose this placement to expand my knowledge of the current societal situation and understanding of complex challenges.  

Identity 

I realized later that choosing Greenpeace was partly driven by an unconscious desire to be part of something "cool”, something that would ignite my inner need to feel special 😉.  

Developing, landing and adapting a collaboration agreement with an organization  Looking back, I realize this was an occasion to shape the placement in a way that aligned more with my abilities and Greenpeace's wishes and ressources. 

Preferably in the future, I would sit down with my client (physically) and make the agreement a collaborative process and allow important conversations in the process. This approach could also have addressed the onboarding challenge and clarifying of what I can bring as a Kaospilot. However, the client mentioned uncertainty about how many resources they could use for an onboarding process.  Fostering generative relationships with the partner I’ve realized that building generative relationships requires both curiosity and confidence. A lack of curiosity makes it hard to be open to new learning. This was the experience I had during my placement which I found a bit frustrating. When I tried to bring in my frustration about this it was kindly met but was replied with different (similar) tasks instead of it opening up for a conversation on how to shape the collaboration differently.  When that is said confidence is just as important. I could have taken more responsibility and tried push more in shaping my placement a different way.    Handling of parralel tasks  One of my main challenges during this placement was balancing and integrating my research with my tasks at Greenpeace. I often felt like I was in two places at once which negatively affected my motivation.   Early on I explored how I could integrate my research in my work but they qucikly became separate things. I accepted this but it left me with a sense of not contributing in a meaningful way. I shared this frustration, but instead of exploring how to utilize my research in my work at Greenpeace, we stayed in the same context of everyday “maintenance” tasks. This experience taught me the importance of super clear and concrete communication about what I want to and can bring.  

This separation was enhanced by my physical presence. When I worked on my research, I was physically disconnected from the organization (I was home in Aarhus).  I think all this led me to focus more on the larger ecosystem than on Greenpeace itself, which wasn’t necessarily bad, but I think a more focused perspective on Greenpeace would have helped me not get overwhelmed by information and find a focus in my research which I never really did.   Its worth mentioning that being part of the organization's everyday culture was an exciting way to research. I learned a lot from being curious around the coffee machine, at lunch or in the open office. 

RESEARCH OVERVIEW  

My research question changed a lot during the period, but this is my current questions.  

Question 1 - Personal  How can activism enhance my practice? 

Question 2 - Activism What role does activism play in societal challenges and how does societal challenges affect the work of activism?  Question 3 – Personal  How to accelerate change by embracing spaces for slowness and curiosity?  

CRAFT & PRACTICE  INTRUDCUTION MISSING 

Challenges during my placement 

A different work environment Digital work: (PICTURE!!) 

All work happens digitally at Greenpeace which is great for a big organization that needs to communicate internationally but I learned how highly it affects my mental energy and sense of overview. I faced this by implementing more analog work when unfolding my research which both released energy in my work and created a bigger sense of overview. 

Meetings: I experienced meetings as conversations rather than a session with a goal using facilitation tools. This might not be unusual, but it challenged me in finding a focus and contributing to meetings. I spend a lot of energy on this but didn’t manage to work with this challenge and propose new ways of doing meetings but at that time I don’t think I felt in a position and had the surplus to do so.  At a late point I requested to do less meetings which allowed me to put in more focused work, but it also made me more disconnected from the teams. So, next time I would not consider if less meetings or taking more leadership in meetings is the right thing.    My inner challenges  

Trusting my own judgement “‘Is this the right thing to do?’ or ‘Should I do it in another way?’ are a few inner, unconscious questions I have posed to myself. I don’t see myself as insecure, but this has affected my flow and focus quite a lot. After realizing this, I tried to take more action but remains a challenge and a good reminder for the future.  Lack of experience I realized that I don't have much work experience, which I think is an important acknowledgment. Accepting being new to something create space for curiosity, and it motivates me to take on more concrete projects.  Activity vs. Productivity  Activity doesn’t equal productivity. The more you are active in the Slack chat, attend meetings, or spend time in front of the computer or in the office doesn’t necessarily mean you’re producing more; sometimes, it’s the opposite and of lower quality. This was hard to practice because being alone in a new place sparked a sense of performativity. 

Finding a purpose when faced with a collapsing world 

When exploring activism, and the big challenges of the world I reached a wall of hopelessness. A conversation with an experienced activist, Jakob, struck me deeply.  I presented a reflection on how a transition from narrow sighted and unreflected behaviours through visioning was where I saw the neccecary change.   Jakob answered, “I once thought that as well, but we’ve reached the point where behavioural change is not enough; we need decisions from above.” 

This sparked existential questions and reflections. For a long while, I felt paralyzed. 

Then I noticed: places like Greenpeace keep saying, “We can turn it around.” and we can reach the 1.5 degrees. Why? Not because it's perfectly realistic and important to reach a perfect goal — but because daring to be idealistic and hopeful is what can create that change. 

This left me to realize it's about acting within my own context and capacity because every small action matters in the long run – also behavioural change. 

It helped me to look back at movements in history — from the resistance against the Nazis to the fight against apartheid — because they all shared that idealistic, hopeful vision, even in the face of hopelessness. 

That’s why it's important to keep saying, "We can turn it around." 

This might seem as universal or cliché reflection but this shift in mindset has been one of my most important learnings, and something I will carry with me in all my future work.  

 Craft and abilities learned from this placement  Research and analytical thinking I really got to practice deep diving and thoroughly understanding a topic and in my future projects I now have a much deeper understanding of the big societal challenges we are facing today which i see as a big strength.  

Communication I’ve learned about campaigning and how central communication is to creating change — and how many different creative ways you can do this, from memes, reels and video games to scientific reports, photography and films.  One of the tasks I worked on was writing a blog about the main challenges and solutions to the climate crisis. It was a great opportunity to practice not only research and analysis, but also how to translate complex political, scientific, and economic topics into something understandable to “normal” people. 

Systemic practice  

During my last project on Kaospilot, I was introduced to systems practice — and it completely shifted how I see my education. It gave my work meaning and purpose because I realized systems thinking isn’t just a tool, but a life practice (amen ;). I also saw how the lack of systemic thinking in everyday life is one major cause of many societal and organizational challenges.  That’s why I asked my previous project partner to mentor me and support my journey deeper into systems practice. I applied this approach in my personal research project, and it became one of the biggest skill takeaways from this placement — both practically and personally.   Adapting to a context 

Entering a new workplace alone was a big challenge. I normally adapt quickly by picking up on unspoken cultural cues, but reflecting on this, I actually want to adapt less. During my placement, I found myself dropping my own ways of working too fast — especially compared to how I would act in a project group. I think it would have benefited both me and Greenpeace if I had brought 100% of myself. I could have challenged the digital workflows, the creative processes, and more. Moving forward, I’ll remind myself to ask: "How would I approach this if it were just me?" — and bring that into collaborations. 

 🌿 Organisational Development – 5 Insights from Greenpeace  A lot of the following observations and reflections are strategic considerations which requires even deeper research but my goal with this is to ask the right questions that might lead to conversations or reflections for me or Greenpeace.  I want to note that all this is shallow overviews that stems from only 3 months of experiencing this ecosystem. Though each point stems from several observations and/or research.  

A High-Paced Environment Limit reflection 

Greenpeace operates at a high pace, and I like to describe them as an expanded media house. All working hours are spent either in front of a screen or in meetings. I often heard “we are busy” or “we lack resources.” When breaking news hits, the talk begins, and the immediate reaction is to respond — fast. In meetings it’s always goal oriented focused on the “what” and “how”, never why. Reflection: This speed creates momentum and can be necessary to stay relevant to current situations, but it also leaves little space for pausing, processing, or thinking long-term in the everyday work. Development requires time to step back and reflect and let creativity and curiosity flow — that’s hard to do when urgency dominates. Also, high pace and only reacting makes Greenpeace a “product” of the time, which means that instead of shaping the agenda, they risk being shaped by it. When urgency always comes first, it becomes harder to lead with clarity and purpose. Development needs space — not just to respond, but to dare, rethink, reimagine, and reset direction when needed. Greenpeace have operated the same way since the 70’s. Perhaps it is time for Greenpeace to dare to reimagine new ways of operating? 

No Structure Limits Idea Development 

During “brainstorm meetings” and meetings in general, I noticed there wasn’t a structured process for developing ideas. It was more of a conversation where people threw things out, but there was no method to shape or build on them. For me at least this was very difficult to be creative and have meaningful conversations.  Reflection: Developing isn’t just about sparking ideas — it’s about creating the environment and processes where they can evolve. Where, you create a space for experimentation and curiosity that allows original and well reflected ideas to rise. As I spoke about earlier, I see this as one of the sinners of not taking conscious and reflected decisions. Designing the facilitation will take some of the valuable time but the session will be more interesting, well-structured and will achieve better quality ideas.  

Strong Strategy, Lack of focus on Internal Community 

Greenpeace’s strategy is centered around hope, action, and community. But in reality, the “community” part often only focuses on external instead of internal. From several conversations with activists, I learned that community is a big part of the actual motivation towards being an activist though Greenpeace has very few volunteers.  Reflection: Culture eats strategy. I see the community when a big protest is arranged but right now in Greenpeace, I see a gap between strategy and lived experience. For me the community culture within the organisation gets no attention which I think affects creativity, joy and engagement. Speaking with an activist from Den Grønne Ungdomsbevægelse (a movement with a big community) and an old Greenpeace activist I learned that they hang (and hung) out. I believe if Greenpeace are to use community as their greatest tool which is stated in the strategy, they must also nurture their internal community.  

Volunteers: Used or Empowered? 

I observed that volunteers are only called up when there’s not enough time for a task — not as ongoing co-creators. They aren’t really shaping the organisation as I see it. To be fair, one of the campaigns did this by inviting the volunteers to a session early on in their process. Reflection: Volunteers could be more than an extra pair of hands; they hold fresh perspectives and deep motivation as is already stated in the strategy. Embedding them meaningfully could strengthen both passion and creativity in the whole organization. This must be done in respect of them being their voluntarily so it’s more about how and why to include them rather than how much.    

Identity vs. Service – Who Are We Really For? 

In Greenpeace’s strategy document, one sentence among others with similar tone stood out: “Our community will help us fight for the middle.” It made me ask: is Greenpeace working for people, or are people working for Greenpeace? 

Reflection: That might not seem like a big deal in a strategy doc, but to me it’s important — because it connects to something I kept noticing: a lack of collaboration across movements that actually share the same visions. Rather than focusing on the larger purpose of creating change, I often saw how each NGO and movements almost fight for the attention which i belive damage to shared vision.  

A shift in perspective — from they help us to we help them — could unlock new ways of thinking about how to mobilise citizens and collaborate with others around a shared purpose. If the goal is systemic change, it has to start with understanding the full ecosystem: who’s part of it, what matters to them, and how we can connect and mobilise them around a common vision.  The concern i think Greenpeace would have to this is that this weakens the brand or dilutes identity. I actually believe the opposite: designing with and for people creates a much stronger, more relevant identity. 

 🔍 Business Development – 5 Insights from Greenpeace   

Development Isn’t Only About Profit — It’s About Impact 

Greenpeace doesn’t only “grow” in the traditional monetary sense. Instead, everything is geared towards achieving maximum impact for the planet. Reflection: My mind comes to economical profit which when i think “business” but Greenpeace is not realy about that money. So, I learned that the development of the “business” is about developing their ability to gain impact.  

Revenue is the backbone of Greenpeace 

While Greenpeace isn’t for-profit, revenue is the backbone of operations. No revenue no Greenpeace. Greenpeace's revenues are driven by 3 types of donations. 1. offs, Subscription and Testimonies. How Greenpeace are different from others is their high ambition of who do they take money from. Greenpeace want to remain fully independent which means they take money from individuals and if it is funds then they are screened to make sure that they are aligned with their values.    Reflection: If you want to be impactful long-term, you need stable income — even if you are trying to fight climate change. This is definitely a mindset that I have to practice 😉.  

Partnerships Can Be Transformative or Stagnant 

Greenpeace are using and developing on creative partnerships - partnering with famous people in their campaigns. (See appendix) This kind of partnership Greenpeace are strong at but what I observed is that there are not so many partnerships where it’s about co-creating something for a common cause – it's often Greenpeace has developed something that they use partnerships to get out there.  Reflection: Partnerships are super powerful to strengthen your own agenda, but it is also what can help you grow — not just echo. Development means opening to new ways of thinking, not just reinforcing your own. As mentioned in [“Identiy Vs. Service](bookmark://_5._Identity_vs.)”. It requires resources but the hard part is bridging and seeing beyond yourself (A systemic mindset).  

Busy Culture Blocks Iteration 

Greenpeace has been running campaigns since 1971 and know exactly which and when is the next campaign — but I saw little space for iteration. The team is busy trying to follow the overall structure given from Greenpeace international (that real feedback processes (both internal and external) don’t seem prioritized. Reflection: Development relies on learning. Without built-in loops for feedback, it’s hard to evolve. It’s both in campaign development phases and overall feedback from not only within the organisation but the citizens that Greenpeace aim to mobilize. E.g. “Why do more people feel rejected from activism?” This again ties together with [Identity vs. Service – Who Are We Really For?.](bookmark://_5._Identity_vs.) If you are to really make an impact you must understand your audience on a deep level.  

Citizen Engagement Is an Untapped Growth Area 

Most campaigns focus on political pressure. While that has its value, I believe change needs to start with citizens. 

Reflection: One of the biggest challenges activism faces today is being ignored by the political system and citizens — because modern politics is more about winning voters than listening. (Hurray for democracy.) That’s why I think the power of activism lies in engaging people directly — not just asking for support, but creating spaces where “normal people” can act, influence, and take part - Activism must not become a niche.  

What Shapes Activism Today? 

In the following section, I explore some of the broader forces that I see affecting activism today. These are big themes, and yes, they can feel overwhelming. But I believe they are important to understand, because they shape how activism works today and where it struggles. By naming them, I hope to better understand how to act within them. 

The Media and the Digital Era 

The media is the bridge between political matters and citizens, giving it huge power. But with this comes a challenge — its only goal isn’t just to inform; it’s also to get as many views, clicks, and listeners as possible. And in today’s fast-paced world, we’ve all become used to high-speed, dopamine-filled content that’s easy to consume and constantly available. This means the media tends to focus on what gets attention right now — the dramatic, the sensational, the instantly rewarding – like Trump news.  

This makes it harder for activist organizations to get people to focus on the more complex issues that require real attention, understanding, and action. Greenpeace, for instance, has adapted to this by creating quick, catchy content — short videos, memes, bold headlines — to meet people where they are. But the problem remains the same: we’re all overloaded with information — at home, at work, and in our pockets. This constant flood of content reduces our mental capacity and attention span, making meaningful engagement harder. People end up reacting superficially — liking, sharing — or they completely disengage, becoming overwhelmed or just tuning out. 

So, how do activist organizations get people to do more than just scroll past? How can they get us to stop, understand, and take action on issues that really matter when everything around us is designed to grab attention for just a moment? 

Monarchy of Fear 

Martha Nussbaum writes in her book Monarchy of Fear that we live in societies driven by fear — societies where fear has become an invisible guiding star, infiltrating political, organizational, and personal decisions. The problem is that when we’re gripped by fear, we forget to look ahead and around us, which is crucial for making reflective and conscious decisions. 

Change always involves some form of loss or letting go of what we know. That’s why, when the world around us shifts, we feel a stronger need to feel secure in our identity. We need to be able to answer questions like “Who am I, and what does my future look like?” in an unpredictable world. 

Activism is about advocating for change, and when society is driven by this kind of fear, activism will always meet resistance rather than support. This is not something new to humans — it’s fundamental. However, something has changed, especially in the wealthier parts of the world. We have increased our wealth, which makes us more comfortable, and stepping out of that comfort becomes unfamiliar and unpleasant. It also paints a false image that we have more to lose. As we get more wealth and comfort, we start to feel like we have more to lose. And that fear of losing what we’ve gained makes it harder to embrace change.” 

Democracy & Ingrained Structures  

The challenge with democracy today is that it no longer takes its stand in the citizens it’s meant to represent. It’s become less about people and more about politicians — I see it in the same way I described Greenpeace’s identity: who are we really for? This affects activism because politicians are simply less likely to act on behalf of citizens or activist voices. 

On top of that, we’ve built deeply ingrained systems that aren’t designed to change. It’s hard to imagine new structures, and implementation takes forever. This creates mistrust, polarization, and apathy — citizens disengage, and activism struggles to mobilise them. But mobilising people is exactly what activism needs to do if it wants to create real impact in a democratic system. 

  

High Pace 

Every part of society today is infiltrated by a high-paced growth and competitive mindset. This culture of acceleration shapes how organizations like Greenpeace work, pushing them to react quickly and keep up with the fast-moving world. 

This fast pace also impacts how people engage with activism. As citizens, we’ve grown accustomed to constant stimulation and instant gratification. This behavior shift means movements risk becoming just short-lived bursts of energy, sparking initial excitement but not allowing for deep, sustained involvement. The issue here is that, when everything needs to be fast, it discourages people from committing to the slow, steady work that real change demands. The deeper conversations, long-term relationship-building, and collective strategies required for lasting transformation take time and patience—qualities that are often lost in the rush to “do something now.” 

What I Learned About Activism and My Future Relationship to It 

Through my placement, I learned that activism is a fundamental part of being human — not something extreme or distant, but something that happens in everyday life, in work, and in community. To simplify my understanding, I broke activism down into three essential pillars: 1. A Challenge: There must be something you believe needs to change. 2. Hope: There must be a vision for a better situation. 3. Action: There must be action connecting the challenge and hope — otherwise, it’s just an idea, not activism. 

Reflecting on this, I realized that the Kaospilot education is essentially a form of activism: learning to understand challenges, imagine better futures, and act creatively to move toward them. This way of simplifying activism made it more real and approachable for me. 

Working inside Greenpeace, however, also gave me a deeper understanding of the complexity of activism as a field. I saw that real-world activism often involves navigating organisational structures, resource limitations, and the slow pace of systemic change. It is not only about passion and action, but also about strategy, patience, and resilience. 

After this experience, I feel even more motivated to continue working with activism — but in my own way. I want to integrate the activist thinking action orientation into my future practice, whether inside organisations, communities, or projects. 

   

My Further Project: Exploring Slowness and Curiosity in High-Paced Environments 

In a world driven by urgency, I want to explore how slowing down can become a radical act of system change. 

One of the clearest insights from my placement was how deeply the high pace of society — and organisations like Greenpeace — affects both individuals and collective creativity. I personally experienced how constant acceleration leads to mental and physical disconnection, and how environments focused on reproduction rather than originality drain motivation and energy. 

During my placement, I began exploring how practicing slowness and creating space for curiosity could reconnect me to a deeper sense of meaning — and bring back my motivation. I experimented with small personal practices of slowing down, such as using reflective thinking, analog tools, and conscious pauses to stay connected to my purpose and energy. At the same time, I applied this in combination with practicing systemic work: Using my placement experience to identify inhibitors, enablers, upstream causes, and downstream effects, and currently shaping feedback loops to understand the deeper dynamics at play and later to create my systems map. 

Based on these experiences, two themes have become central to my future exploration: the practice of slowness, and the cultivation of spaces for curiosity and imagination. 

I want to explore how slowness can become a strategic tool — not just a personal coping mechanism — to counteract the pressures of high-paced environments. I am interested in how slow practices and creative spaces can be embedded into organizational cultures, especially in fields like activism where urgency is unavoidable but depth is crucial. 

Moving forward, I see my work and research focusing on how we can create environments that not only respond to crises, but also nurture long-term, systemic transformation by allowing people to imagine, question, and connect more deeply.
