**Summary**
**Early Action Paradox** – Problems like climate change require action long before their worst effects are felt. However, because these issues develop slowly, there's little urgency, and decision-makers tend to prioritize short-term problems that feel more immediate. This delay often leads to more severe consequences down the line. - “People have a thousand other things higher on the agenda because they happen today or tomorrow,”

**Institutional Lag** – Governments and organizations are built for stability, not rapid change. Policies, laws, and bureaucratic processes often lag behind emerging challenges. This inertia makes it difficult to address long-term issues effectively, as institutions struggle to keep pace with technological, social, or environmental shifts.

**Shadow Interests** – Future generations have a stake in today's decisions but have no voice in current policymaking. This means their interests are often ignored in favor of those with immediate influence (voters, corporations, political donors). As a result, policies tend to favor short-term benefits over long-term sustainability.


Three significant barriers: the ‘early action paradox’, ‘institutional lag’, and ‘shadow interests’. The first term highlights the difficulty of taking ‘early action’ by establishing preventive measures for problems whose effects are not yet felt. For Hale, this is the hardest for two reasons. The first is uncertainty: we can never know exactly what the effects are going to be if no action is taken, which fosters conformist, short-term thinking. The second is a lack of salience. “People have a thousand other things higher on the agenda because they happen today or tomorrow,” as Hale puts it.

Climate change, to reuse that example, has a determined length to it. “Most of the carbon that was burnt in the first locomotives and steam engines is still up there, and it’s absorbed very slowly by oceans and trees and the natural cycles. So that creates a fundamental time component to this problem that we can’t change no matter what we do.”

To Hale, the key point here is that the early action paradox means we focus only on the things we see and feel, such as forest fires, rising sea levels, or droughts that are often experienced as short-term events.


The second barrier, ‘institutional lag’, refers to the rigidity of existing institutions and the kind of solutions they produce. Hale elaborates: “Whenever we want to address a political challenge, typically we have a policy, a regulation, a law, a new agency, maybe an international organisation. Institutions are how we structure interactions and problem solving across society, yet they need to be durable to be effective – they need to be ‘sticky’.”

  

“Of course, as time goes on, this stickiness can become dysfunctional because it creates a gap between the nature of the problem, which can evolve in all sorts of unexpected ways, and the institutions we set up,” Hale says.

  

One example of such dysfunctional stickiness is the UN Security Council, whose veto-holding nations reflect the geopolitical situation in the aftermath of the Second World War, rather than the present. This hinders its ability to effectively maintain international peace and security, as evident in the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. It’s a situation that, as Hale argues, exemplifies institutional dysfunction that is exceedingly difficult to reform.

  

Finally, ‘shadow interests’. These are the interests of unborn, unrepresented future generations. As Hale puts it, “In politics, lots of solutions, or ‘changes’, occur because a group of people with grievances force it through. Even people who don’t have much power at all are important in driving policy change. If you do not exist yet, you can’t do that, meaning that the interests of those people are only shadows in our politics.”
