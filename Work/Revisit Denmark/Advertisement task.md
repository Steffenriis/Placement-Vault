###### **Christiasn Brief**
The aim of the advertisements is to get attention from media and SoMe, which will quickly pick-up the untraditional advertisements... Therefore we spread the advertisement thin. The campaign will spread thin across various formats and locations to appear large-scale.We have one goal: We will look big with a small budget.We have a budget of around 70.000 DKKFor example:  

- a newspaper ad in a famous european newspaper outlet (priority 1)
- a bus ad in Aalborg during a political gathering
- a scaffolding ad in a cheap place
- a radio ad in southern germany - local radio
- Some ad in Brussels
- Online ads in some niche agricultural media
- flyers distributed at key locations
- ads on travel sites like TripAdvisor.
